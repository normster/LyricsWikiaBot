LyricsWikiaBot
==============

Scrapes lyrics from LyricsWikia, analyzes word frequencies, and outputs data to a SQLite database

LyricsWikiaBot is a little script that I wrote for my Linguistics 55AC final project to help automate the analysis of lyrical data from user inputted songs.

Instructions:
1) Populate 'links.txt' files with the full url(s) of the lyric(s) you wish to scrape. Example format is included in original 'links.txt'
2) Run 'LyricsWikiaBot.py'
